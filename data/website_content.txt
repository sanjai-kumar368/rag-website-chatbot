Network Frequency and Signal Quality

SkyNet Fiber uses a wired fiber-optic network for internet delivery. Since fiber does not rely on radio frequencies for last-mile connectivity, it avoids common wireless problems such as signal interference, congestion, and weather-related disruptions.

Wi-Fi is used only within the customer’s home or office to distribute the internet connection from the fiber router to devices.
